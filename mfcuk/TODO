ITEMS
=====
0. Integrate with MFOC into MFCUK
1. Improve the performance (though not bad)
2. Optimize bits operations
3. Remove dead-code/commented block after testing
4. Proper error handling in some cases (not critical errors, but nice to have checks in place)
5. Periodically save the state (or most important part of it at least) such as of Nt/Nr arrays, etc., so that it can later be resumed on the same card
6. Calibration methodology and routine for MFCUK to determine best field on/off delays so that it generates the lowest entropy for tag's Nt values
